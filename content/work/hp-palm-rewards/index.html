<p>Sadly the HP Palm phones didnâ€™t last, but it was not for lack of quality and talent. HP was one of the few clients that had beautiful product photography and a very well-considered set of brand guidelines and style requirements. The requirements both gave us room to explore our own layout concepts but with enough control to align our app with their other sites.</p>
