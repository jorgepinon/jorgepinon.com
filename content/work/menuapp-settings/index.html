<p>Form UI design for a page builder web app. The UX idea here is that the editing page itself should use previously saved design settings (colors, theme, etc). Additionally, if the user chooses to add a background image for their design, the edit form page itself loads that image as a background, just as the final product would appear. </p>

<p>The idea being that the editor has a good idea of the legibility of their final site because the settings page itself mimics the same design that the final site would have.</p>
