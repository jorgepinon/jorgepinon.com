"caption": "Logo design and corporate collateral for International Shipping Partners (ISP). I suggested a simple bold shape to differentiate their logo as much as possible from competitors, and to ensure that it worked well when faxed. What I learned more than anything was how to pitch design ideas to a meeting full of people to which the process of design was completely foreign."
