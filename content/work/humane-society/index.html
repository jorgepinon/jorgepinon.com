<p>When I was a struggling freelancer, transitioning from print design -- to what was then known as “digital”, and now is just “web” -- I was lucky enough to become friends with someone who later became the Director of the Humane Society of Memphis.</p>

<p>I’m sorry that I didn’t stay in Memphis long enough to do more, but it was very fulfilling being able to be part of such a great group of dedicated people.</p>
