# Hóla

I’m a web designer and front-end developer living in Miami Beach with 14+ years experience working on the web. What I like doing best is working on user-centered design ideas from sketch to wireframes, to prototypes, to production code. I’ve been using Illustrator and Photoshop way too long, and I’m comfortable coding client-side HTML, CSS, and JS at all hours of the day and night in a few different environments, like NodeJS, Java, PHP/Wordpress, and Rails.

I’m an avid believer in solving design problems through iteration until a thing is simple and great.

I like working with small teams of talented and passionate designers and developers.

I’m not happy unless I’m learning something new.

In another life I made some [art](/art).

_Do not_ read the [things I’ve written here](/blog/). They suck.

If just one child learns that, in Spanish, the *ñ* is a different letter than the *n* this will all have been worth it.

If you’ve got a project you think I can help with, contact me anytime @jorge@mastodon.design. I also might be on LinkedIn.
